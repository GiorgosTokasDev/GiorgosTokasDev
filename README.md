<h1>Hi, I'm George Tokas! </h1>
I'm a software developer who enjoys working on both game development and desktop applications. I have practical experience with C#, Unity 2D, and databases (especially MySQL), and I love building clean, modular systems that are fun to create and easy to expand.

 My game projects focus on structured gameplay logic, user interaction, and modular mechanics—like my Tower Defense prototype developed during my thesis.
 On the application side, I’ve worked on full inventory systems with features like product management, stock tracking, and reporting using C# WinForms and MySQL.

I enjoy learning new technologies and constantly improving how I write and organize code. Check out my work below!
